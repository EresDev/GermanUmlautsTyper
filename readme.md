# German Umlauts Typer

This script allows you to type German Umlauts easily without using number keys. You can type these umlauts following US international keyboard key's combination. Currently, it only works with memrise.com and is tested on windows only. 

# Other Alternates of Typing Umlauts

  - You can always use Alt + ### keys, more details [here][method1]
  - You can add [US international keyboard][method2]. 


# Why use this script instead?

  - Typing umlauts using Alt+ NUMKeys is pain in the ass. You have to move your typing hand to another world. 
  - US international keyboard allows to type several other characters with umlauts but it also disturbs existing keys like single and double quotes, carrot character, and some others. 
  

# What are key combinations for Umlauts

It is recommended to use right alt key and use your right hand thumb to press alt key for good typing practice. May be at some later point, I will tell you why it is better.
